# My Code, My Cluster, My Coffee: A DevOps Diary

This document chronicles my journey into the world of Kubernetes, microservices, and DevOps. Inspired by the immersive nature of RPGs (role-playing games), I'm embarking on a quest to build a miniature tech company, complete with a multi-faceted team (all played by me!). The goal? To design, develop, and deploy a microservice-based blogging application on a Kubernetes cluster, all while simulating the roles and responsibilities found in a real-world tech environment.

### Why this project?

This project is more than just a technical exercise. It's about immersing myself in the full spectrum of product development, from the ground up. My primary goal is to gain a deep and practical understanding of the entire process:

- **Infrastructure mastery**: Setting up the underlying infrastructure, including VMs and networking.

- **Kubernetes proficiency**: Creating and managing a Kubernetes cluster from scratch using kubeadm.

- **Application development**: Designing and developing a functional blogging application with FastAPI and PostgreSQL.

- **CI/CD automation**: Building a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

- **GitOps implementation**: Exploring GitOps principles for managing infrastructure and application deployments.

- **Monitoring and observability**: Setting up monitoring to track the health and performance of the application and infrastructure.

- **TLS Certificate Management**: Implementing and managing TLS certificates to ensure secure communication.

I believe that true expertise comes not just from theoretical knowledge but from grappling with real-world challenges. This project allows me to uncover and understand the intricacies of each step in a way that simply reading books or watching tutorials cannot replicate.

To further enrich this experience, I'll be exploring the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape and incorporating relevant projects into my workflow wherever possible. This will expose me to a wider range of tools and technologies within the cloud-native ecosystem.

### The Cast of Characters (and their responsibilities)

In this one-person show, I'll be wearing many hats. Here's a breakdown of the key roles I'll be playing and their corresponding responsibilities:

- **Product Manager:**

    - Define the vision and scope of the blogging application.
    - Create user stories and prioritize features.
    - Develop a roadmap with milestones and timelines.
    - Ensure the final product aligns with user needs and business goals.

- **Engineering Manager:**

    - Oversee the technical design and implementation of the application.
    - Make key technology choices (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, etc.).
    - Break down the project into tasks and assign them to the development team (myself!).
    - Conduct code reviews and ensure code quality.

- **Developer:**

    - Write the code for the FastAPI blogging API.
    - Implement database interactions using SQLAlchemy.
    - Develop unit tests and ensure code functionality.
    - Document the code and API endpoints.

- **SRE/DevOps Engineer:**

    - Set up and manage the 3-node Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm.
    - Configure network connectivity and security.
    - Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment.
    - Monitor the health and performance of the application and infrastructure.
    - Potentially use Ansible for infrastructure automation.

- **Scrum Master:**

    - Facilitate the Agile development process.
    - Organize sprints, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews.
    - Track progress, identify blockers, and ensure continuous improvement.

### The Stage is Set

With the roles defined and the curtain about to rise, I'm eager to embark on this adventure. I'll be documenting my progress, challenges, and learnings along the way.  Join me as I navigate the exciting world of Kubernetes and microservices, one role at a time, one cup of coffee at a time!
